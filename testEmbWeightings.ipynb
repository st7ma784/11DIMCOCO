    "The sum is in the form of inputs, of shape n*B*F. However, n is composed of multiple encoders (e0,e1,e2), each of which has a different number of inputs. The total adds to n. \n",
    "\n",
    "the final set of logits is calculated by summing the Inputs @ inputs. therefore we need to weight each encoder's inputs by the number of inputs it has, such that each contributs equally to the final sum of n*n logits.\n",
